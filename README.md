# Vendoaccount_website

The project is a real website whose aim is to profile users and allow them to insert announcements selling their social profiles or games, domains, digital advertising spaces.
In addition to this, a messaging system has been added, such as forum sites, in order to give users the opportunity to write under the relevant ads.

The site was built entirely in PHP.

The design is full responsive to adapt to navigation from smartphone or tablet. The template elements have been inserted through bootrap 4, HTML5 and CSS3.
The JQuery library and animate.css were also used.

Every graphic has been realized through ADOBE Illustrator.

The database on which user information is allocated has been implemented with the MySQL server APACHE.
