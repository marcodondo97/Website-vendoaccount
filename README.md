# Website-vendoaccount

<h2>Introduction </h2>
The project is a real website, the goal is to profile users and allow them to insert announcements to sell their social profiles or games accounts, domains, digital advertising spaces.
In addition to this I added a messaging system, like a forum site, in order to give users the opportunity to write under the relevant ads.

<h2>Description</h2>
The site was built entirely in PHP.
The design is full responsive to adapt the navigation from smartphone or tablet. The template elements have been inserted through bootstrap 4, HTML5 and CSS3, JQuery library and animate.css 
The database has been implemented with MySQL.
Every graphic has been realized through ADOBE Illustrator.
